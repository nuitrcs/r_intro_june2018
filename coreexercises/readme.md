# Exercises

Exercise files have one RMarkdown file (with answers) and two HTML files (one with and one without answers). 

Remember if downloading files directly from GitHub, download the RAW version of the file, not the preview.  Or, the easier option for the HTML is to use the links below.

Exercises or parts marked as "challenge" typically require you to use functions, skills, or packages that we didn't cover in the workshop.  

Remember: there are other solutions to many of the exercises.  Just because you did it differently, doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong.
