# read in the safi data, then do the tasks below

# What are the names of the variables in the data (the columns)
names(safi)

# How many observations in the data?
nrow(safi)

# Open the data frame in the viewer
# hint: use the View() function or click on the data in the Environment pane

# What are the types of the variables?

# Make village a factor instead of character

# Make a table of respondent_wall_type to see how many observations for each;
# what do you notice?

# Select just village and no_membrs columns (the latter is number of family members)

# Drop the instanceID column

# select the column respondent_wall_type for just the rows where the village is God
safi[safi$village == "God", "respondent_wall_type"]

# select rows where no_membrs is > 2 and < 5
safi[safi$no_membrs > 2 & safi$no_membrs < 5,]
